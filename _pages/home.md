### Welcome!

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations.

### About me

Arman Farhang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Trinity College Dublin. He received his PhD in wireless communications from Trinity College Dublin, Ireland in 2016. Prior to this, he was an Assistant Professor at Maynooth University and University College Dublin in Ireland. He has published over 60 peer-reviewed international journal and conference papers, 4 book chapters, 1 edited book, and he holds 2 patents. Dr Farhang is a Principal Investigator of the project NEW WAVE (New Waveforms for Next Generation Wireless Networks) funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under the research excellence award, Frontiers for the Future. He is also a member of SFI research centres ADVANCE-CRT and CONNECT as a PhD student supervisor and an Associate Investigator, respectively, where he leads research around the topics of waveform design and multiple antenna systems for future wireless networks. The focus of Dr Farhang's research team is on the design of novel physical layer technologies and advanced modulation schemes, bolstered with multiple antenna solutions to provide high reliability, low latency, and scalability to the wireless networks of the future. He is a senior member of IEEE and serves as an associate editor for the EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking since 2018. He served as a member of the Organization Committee of the IEEE ICC 2020. He regularly serves as a TPC in top-tier IEEE conferences and workshops in addition to being an active reviewer of several major IEEE journals.
